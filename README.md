This repository contains some ready to use execute Linux shell scripts that I developped and I used personnaly.

They consist on the automation of tasks I found myself doing more than once, are time consuming or could be done better by the computer. ( Configuring services, installing/updating software, managing files and disks, monitoring load etc.)

Feel free to fork this and send a pull request :-)
